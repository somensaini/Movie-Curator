## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js.

This application was built on the MERN stack. User data is stored in MongoDB upon registration. Once a user begins to add items to their list or favorites, that data will be stored with a relation to the User. 

## Optimizations:
Implement JWT Authentication.

Dynamically create individual movie pages with extended information.

Create a community feature where User's are able to discuss movies with other members.

## Lessons Learned:
This application was developed in collaboration with a team of developers. It taught us the importance of managing workflow as a team and understanding how to handle the scope of a project. We were able to resolve issues as a result of sharing our diverse perspectives on approaching a problem, whether it was front-end or back-end related.
